what is method overloading in Java:
    with the help of method overloading we can have many methods with the same name
    but different parameters in a class
Why we should use Method Overloading:
    1) Cleaner code if multiple methods are doing the same thing
    we don't need to come up with different name
    2) Flexibility for the end user.
How we can use method overloading in Java:
    we can overload a method by changing three things
    1) Number of parameters
    2) Change the data type of parameters
    3) we can change the sequence of parameters.

int sum(int num1, int num2){
return num1+num2;
}
int sum(int num1, int num2, int num3){
return num1+num2+num3;
}
double sum(double num1, int num2, int num3){
return num1+num2+num3;
}

RULES:
    1) method names should be same, but parameters should be different
    2) we can't overload method just by just changing its return type
    3) we can also overload constructors by following the same rules
