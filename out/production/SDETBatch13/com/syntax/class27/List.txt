List is the first interface that we will be discussing from the collections framework:
List:
    we can store duplicate data
    insertion order is maintained

ArrayList:
    LinkedList class:
        joining in a minute
Difference between ArrayList and Linked List:
    ArrayList:
            Upside: Retrieval(get operation) of elements is super Fast
            Downside: adding elements in the middle or start will be very expensive(a lot of shifting)

    LinkedList:
            Upside: whenever we have to insert the data randomly not at the last index, we should be using
                    llinked list
            Downside: retrieval is super slow if the lis is big
