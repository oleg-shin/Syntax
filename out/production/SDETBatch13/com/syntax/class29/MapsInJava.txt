Map:
    Allow to store key value pairs.
    First Entry is treated as key and second one is value.
    Keys can't be duplicate but values can be.

    Map<Integer, String> items = new HashMap<>();

    There are many types of Map as sets but we will only discuss 3 of them:
        1) HashMap
        2) LinkedHashedMap
        3) TreeMap

HashMap:
    it is fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the data
    Downside: insertion order is not maintained

LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: insertion order is maintained
    Downside: insertion speed is slower than HashMap, retrieval speed is slowest of all

TreeSet:
    Upside: Data is stored in sorted form always
    Downside: insertion speed is very slow

Choose proper DataStructur.

    Q2: Store the names of the students and most of the time we will be performing operation
    relating to data retrieval based on index
    A: ArrayList
