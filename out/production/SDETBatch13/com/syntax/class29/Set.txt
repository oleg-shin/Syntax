Set:
    Set in java does not allow duplicate values. There are many types of sets but
    we will only discuss the most widely used which are:
        1) HashSet
        2) LinkedHashset
        3) TreeSet

HashSet:
    Most commonly used type of set it is fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve data.
    Donwside: Insertion order is not maintained
    No get method to get a single value

LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained
    Downside: insertion speed is comparable to Shaset but the retrieval speed is slowest

TreeSet:
    Upside: The Data is stored in the sorted form
    Downside: Insertion speed is slow. Retrieval speed is better than linkedHashSet, bust slower than Hashset

They are mostly used to remove duplicates.
