Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in java that help us control the access of classes,
    variables, methods and other code of block.
    There are 4 access levels in Java:
        1) Private
        2) Default(is not a keyword)
        3) Protected
        4) Public
    We have 3 keywords that define access level:
        1) private
        2) protected
        3) public

private:
    When use the private keyword with a method or field it is only accessible inside that class.
    It is the most restricted access modifier

default(is not a keyword):
    When we don't use any access modifier keyword with a field or a method,
    then default access is applied by java, which means we acan access this varieable
    or method inside the same as well as in all the other classes which exists inside the same package

protected:
    When we have protected access modifier we access that method or variable inside the same class
    and inside the other other classes which are inside the same package,
    inside the classes which are in different packages as well,
    but the must have extends relationship the original class

public:
    When we use public access modifier, we can use that field or method anywhere inside the same project,
    the same class, other packages.
