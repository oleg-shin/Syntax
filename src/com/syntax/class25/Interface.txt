What is interface:
    is a contract that is similar to a class, but all the fields inside a class.
    public static final - constants
    all the method by default are also public

Why we should learn about interfaces:
    We can implement abstraction using interface
    when class are logically connected to each other
    we want to have instance fields and implemented method as well
    while doin abstraction then we should go with abstract class

How can I use an interface:
    We use interface keyword instead of a class and we can start creating abstract methods

Rules:
    1) All the fields inside an interface are public static and final
    2) No instance fields, means no constructor is required
    3) no instance methods in an interface and all the methods by default are abstract
    4) when we implement the methods from the interface we use implements keyword
    5) multiple inheritance is supported by interfaces in java
    6) An interface can extend anthor interface
    7) variables in interfaces can't be private
