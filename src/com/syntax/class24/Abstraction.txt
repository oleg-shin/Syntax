What is abstraction:
    Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and only
    showing the functionality/ it's 3rd pilar of OOps

Why we should use abstraction:
    1) It reduces the complexity by separating the ideas from omplementations
    2) we can also enforce rules on other classes

How can we use the abstraction:
    we can use abstraction in our code with the help pf abstract classes and interfaces
    we create abstract method with only the header and mark the class as abstract now
    every class that will be inheriting from this class will either implement those methods or
    mark the child class abstract as well

Rules:
    1) Abstract methods can't have a body
    2) As soon as we have one abstract method in a class that class must be declared as abstract
    3) once a class inherit from an abstract class that class must implenet the abstract methods or it
    should be marked as abstract
    4) we can have normal methods with body and abstract methods inside a class
    5) we can't create the object of abstract classes
    6) abstract classes can't be declared as final classes
    7) we can have everything inside an abstract that we can have in a normal/concrete class
    8) only thing that differs is we can't create the object of that class
