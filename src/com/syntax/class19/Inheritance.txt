extends kewyword :
we are able to access the methods from parent class

What is inheritance:
    Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can get the properties and methods
    from Parent class inside the child class
Why we should use inheritance:
    Inheritance helps uus reduce the amount of code that we have to write.
    For example: if there are some properties and methods which are present in many different classes
    we can create parent class for all of those properties and can put the common properties or methods
    inside that parent class and can make children classes extend from parent class
How we can use inheritance:
    1) Create a parent class
    2) put all the common methods and properties from children classes inside that parent class
    3) use extends keyword to inherit from that parent class
Types of inheritance:

Rulse:
    1) private fields and private methods can't be inherited inside the children classes
    2) constructor are also not inherited

Single inheritance - only one parent and one child

Hierarchical inheritance - more than one child classes have the same parent class
