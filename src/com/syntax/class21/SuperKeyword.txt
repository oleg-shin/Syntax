what is super kewword:
    super keyword in java is used to refer to the parent class object.
why should we learn super keyword:
    1) if we have same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class then we
    can use the super keyword to refer to parent class variable or method because by
    default java prefers the variable of child class. We can also call the super class
    constructor with the help of super with parenthesis super():
how to use super keyword:
    1) We can use super. method name or field name to call the method or to access
    the field of super class
    2) use super with parenthesis to call the super class constructor super()
rules:
    1) can only access the immediate parent class constructor or
    field or method with the help of super keyword
    2) we can only use super()  inside the constructor
    3) if we have user created a constructor in the parent class, we must have a matching constructor
    inside the child classes as well
    4) super() should be the first line a costructor
