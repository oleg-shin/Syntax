What is the method:
    Method in Java is a block of code(group of Java statements).
    It defines the behavior of a class

Why we should muse methods:
    It helps us remove the duplicate code from our app.
    We just create a method and everytime we need that logic,
    we just call the method that contains the logic
    It also, allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes the development
    of large app easier.

How to use Methods:
    1) We create a method inside the class
    2) Create object of that class
    3) Call the method by writing the nameOfTheObject.nameOfTheMethod()

Example:

class Calculator{

    void add(int a, int b){
        System.out.println(a+b);
}
    public static void main(String[] args){

    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

    calculator.add(10,20);

    }
}

Rules to create and use method:

void add (int a, int b){
        System.out.println(a+b);
}

1) void => void is a return type and it is a must,
    if you want to return specific data type write the name of that data type
    for example: for an integer write int, for String - String,
    if we don't want to return anything we write void
    when we write a void we can't assign a method call to a variable
    cannot use return in void method - because void means no data will be returned from this method
    methods with void return type that can't be assign to variable
2) add => next we write the name of the method, which can be anything
          it should follow the rules for giving a name to a variable
3) () => we specify the parameters inside, we can pass any data type inside these parenthesis
        They are optional, we can leave them empty
3.1) add (int a, int b) => called signature of the method
3.2) void add (int a, int b) = > called header of the method
4) {} => the body of the method, that contains contains the java statements

Type of Variables in Java:
There are 3 types of variables 1)instance, 2)local, 3)static

1) if a variable inside the class, but outside of any block of code, like method, loop,
   switch statement, if/else condition - INSTANCE variable
2) if variable inside any method or a loop, switch statement/ if else condition - LOCAL variable
3) if an instance variable has a static keyword with it, then it is called STATIC variable

Why learn about different types of variables:
    1) It helps us reduce the amount of RAM that our app will be using when it will be running
    2) With the help of these variables we can pass information between methods of class
    3) Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time as soon as your method is done
        executing, they are destroyed by a special program called garbage collector

How to use these:
    Local: create inside block of code

Pros vs cons

Local variables:
pros:
    they occupy the memory for the shortest period of time, always try to use local variables when possible
cons:
    they are very limited in scope - we can't access them outside of method or that block of code

Instance variables:
pros:
    they have broader scope as compared to local variables - we can access them in all the methods of that class
cons:
    they occupy space in your RAM for longer period of time

Static variables:
pros:
    We can call static variables without creating an object of a class
    We can share a single variable between all the objects of a class
